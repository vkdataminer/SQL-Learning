----Normalization in MS SQL
Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy (duplicate data) and improve data integrity. 
It involves dividing large tables into smaller ones and defining relationships between them.

##Why Normalize?
Eliminate redundant data: Reduce duplicate storage.
Ensure data integrity: Keep data consistent.
Make database easier to maintain and update.

#Normalization Process
Normalization is done in stages, called Normal Forms (NF). Each stage builds on the previous one.

--------------------------------
Example: Student Database
Step 1: Unnormalized Table (UNF)
Suppose we have a single table:

StudentID	StudentName	Course	Instructor
1	Alice	Math	Prof. Brown
2	Bob	Science, Math	Dr. White, Prof. Brown
3	Charlie	History	Dr. Green
