Function in SQL Server:
A function in MS SQL Server is a database object that allows you to encapsulate a reusable block of code. 
Functions can accept input parameters and return a value. 
Functions are often used to perform calculations, manipulate data, and return results in queries.

Function Definition
A function in SQL Server is defined using the CREATE FUNCTION statement. It can be either a scalar function (returns a single value) or a table-valued function 
(returns a table). 
Functions are used to encapsulate reusable logic, which can be invoked in SQL queries or other functions.
