---The UNPIVOT operation in SQL Server is used to reverse the PIVOT operation. 
---It transforms columns back into rows. This is useful when you need to convert columns into row data.
#########Syntax of UNPIVOT:
SELECT <column_list>
FROM 
(
    <source_query>
) AS SourceTable
UNPIVOT
(
    <value_column> FOR <pivot_column> IN (<column_list_to_unpivot>)
) AS UnpivotTable;
---------------------------------

value_column: The name of the new column that will hold the unpivoted data.
pivot_column: The name of the new column that will hold the column names (turned into row values).
IN (<columns>): The list of columns to unpivot.

---------------------------
Example: Unpivoting Monthly Sales Data
Consider the following Sales table:

Product	January	February	March
ProductA	500	600	700
ProductB	300	400	500
------------------

Step 1: Create the Sales Table

CREATE TABLE Sales
(
    Product NVARCHAR(50),
    January INT,
    February INT,
    March INT
);

-----------------
Step 2: Insert Sample Data
INSERT INTO Sales (Product, January, February, March)
VALUES
('ProductA', 500, 600, 700),
('ProductB', 300, 400, 500);
--------------------
Step 3: Apply the UNPIVOT Query

SELECT Product, Month, Sales
FROM 
(
    SELECT Product, January, February, March
    FROM Sales
) AS SourceTable
UNPIVOT
(
    Sales FOR Month IN (January, February, March)
) AS UnpivotTable;
-------------------------------------

Explanation:
Source Query:
SELECT Product, January, February, March FROM Sales: Selects the columns you want to unpivot.
UNPIVOT:
Sales FOR Month IN (January, February, March): This turns the columns January, February, and March into rows under a new column Month.

----------------------------
Expected Output:
Product	Month	Sales
ProductA	January	500
ProductA	February	600
ProductA	March	700
ProductB	January	300
ProductB	February	400
ProductB	March	500

-----------Key Points:
UNPIVOT takes multiple columns and turns them into row data.
The result has two columns: one for the original column names (Month) and one for the data (Sales).
This operation is the reverse of PIVOT.
